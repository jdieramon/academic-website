I am a Ramón y Cajal Research Fellow, funded by the [Spanish Reseach State Agency](http://www.aei.gob.es/), and I work in the Department of Genetics at the University of Córdoba (Spain). My research focuses on unraveling the molecular basis controlling agronomic traits in agricultural crops. Understanding how individual genetic variants combine to confer adaptation in specific environments is fundamental to accelerating the introgression of new traits into adapted backgrounds. I integrate bioinformatics with experimentation and am an advocate for gene expression studies in compliance with [MIQE](http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/55/4/611) guidelines. I am particularly passionate about working with Big Data, uncovering biological insights, and extracting value from complex datasets.



Flowering time is a major domestication trait that defines the adaptation of chickpea to different agro-climatic conditions and is therefore a key determinant of its productivity.

## Experience

Previously, I worked in the research groups of **Dr Juan Gil** (University of Cordoba) as a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow** funded by the European Comission under the [Horizon2020](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/221706/factsheet/en) program, and **Dr Lisa J. Rowland** at the Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables Laboratory (2012-2017), [USDA-ARS](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/genetic-improvement-for-fruits-vegetables-laboratory/) (Beltsville, MD, USA). During 2010-2012, I got a postdoctoral position funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the program “Juan de la Cierva”.
